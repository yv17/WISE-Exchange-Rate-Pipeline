# WISE Exchange Rate Pipeline

Hi there, I am documenting this simple project that got myself started with building pipelines on Airflow in PC environment.

If you are a PC user, I hope you will find this documentation helpful if you were to start learning Airflow as a beginner like me. 

This project enables you to build DAGs to obtain and store daily exchange rate of a currency pair of your choice on WISE.
